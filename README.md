# Ant-Colony-Optimization-ACO-for-Traveling-Salesman-Problem-TSP-
This project uses Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) in Python to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). It simulates ants finding the shortest path by updating pheromone trails, showing how teamwork and shared information can help solve complex routing problems.
